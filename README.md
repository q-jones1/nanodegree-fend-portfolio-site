## Introduction

This **Mock Portfolio Website** project was completed as part of a Udacity course assessment. The purpose was to initially create a basic website layout from a pdf design mockup and then customise it to form the basis of your own mock portfolio site. This site could then be further customised in the future if required, to display the eventual work at the end of the Udacity course.
Further details on the Udacity requirements that the project needed to meet are listed at the website link, in the [Background](#background) section.

Note: This site had to be coded by hand from scratch, so no frameworks allowed. Responsive design was applied to the site on completion, but responsive images and accessibility weren't required parts of the assessment, as they hadn't been learned at this point in the course.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure:

1. That you have an up to date version installed _(date of writing 29-05-19)_ of any modern web browser for your device e.g. such as _Chrome, Firefox, Safari._
2. That you have extracted all the files in the .zip or from the github repository, into a single folder on your device.
3. Then just open the `index.html` file.
